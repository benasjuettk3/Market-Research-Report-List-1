<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Neonatal ICU ventilators market is categorized into invasive and non-invasive types. Invasive ventilators involve endotracheal intubation, delivering mechanical ventilation directly into the lungs, which is essential for critically ill infants requiring intensive respiratory support. Non-invasive ventilators facilitate breathing through devices like CPAP or BiPAP masks, minimizing the need for intubation, thus reducing risks of complications. Both types are crucial for managing respiratory distress in neonates, with specific applications depending on the severity of the infant's condition.</p></p>
