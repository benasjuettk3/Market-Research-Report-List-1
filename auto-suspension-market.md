<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Suspension Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Auto Suspension System</li><li>Non-independent Auto Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The auto suspension market comprises two main types: independent and non-independent systems. Independent auto suspension systems allow each wheel to move independently, enhancing ride comfort and handling by reducing the impact of road irregularities. These systems are commonly found in modern vehicles, offering better traction and stability. In contrast, non-independent systems connect the wheels, meaning they move together, which can lead to a stiffer ride. These systems are typically found in older vehicles or heavier trucks, providing durability and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
