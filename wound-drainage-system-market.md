<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wound Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Wound Drainage System</li><li>Closed Wound Drainage System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wound drainage system market comprises two primary types: open and closed wound drainage systems. Open wound drainage systems allow fluid to escape freely from the wound into an absorbent dressing, relying on gravity and external absorption. In contrast, closed wound drainage systems involve a sealed method where fluid is drawn out through a tube connected to a collection device, minimizing infection risk and promoting healing. Both systems are crucial in post-surgical care and managing complex wounds effectively.</p></p>
